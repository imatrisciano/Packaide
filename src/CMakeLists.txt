# Python bindings for Packaide

# Find packages for Python library and boost-python.
#
# NOTE: Depending on OS, packaging, etc, these libraries might have
# different names... e.g., boost-python might be called boost-python3
# and PythonLibs might default to Python 2 instead of Python 3. These
# will, for now, require system specific fiddling to fix the versions
# to match whatever works for you locally.
